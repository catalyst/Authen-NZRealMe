libauthen-nzrealme-perl (1.21-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * new upstream release:
      - Support both the current and upcoming new RealMe platform.
      - The replatformed RealMe has changed behaviour so that the:
        . Login Service always returns NameIDFormat as 'persistent'.
        . Assertion returns NameIDFormat as 'transient' for "Assert Only"
          and 'persistent' for "Assert and Login".
      - NameIDFormat is now read from the service provider metadata files
        For backwards compatibility, if NameIDFormat is not in the metadata,
        then Assertion assumes transient and Login assumes persistent.
      - the nzrealme make-meta now adds a NameIDFormat element to metadata files
        This command is enhanced to set the isDefault attribute to one
        AssertionConsumerService element.
      - The rePlatformed RealMe now returns the Assertion resolution response
        in JSON format, base64 encoded. For existing RealMe integrations, the
        original XML format may be returned still, with an option to use JSON.
        Both response formats will be supported for backwards compatiblility.
      - Supports new xenc_oaep_mgf1p and xenc_aes256cbc encryptions.
      - Assertions using the "Assert and Login" mode will receive the FLT
        as part of the Assertion resolution response, no back-channel required.
        For backward-compatibility, the FLT is only resolved via the iCMS back
        channel if the NameIDFormat is transient and the resolve_flt parameter
        is true. In the new platform, iCMS is not used.
      - iCMS functionality is deprecated, it will be removed in the next release.
        It will be decommissioned by RealMe after 18th March 2021.
      - Parameter acs_index set to 'default' will use the ACS with isDefault="true"
