=head1 NAME

Authen::NZRealMe::TokenGenerator - generate SAML ID strings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is responsible for generating random ID tokens such as:

  e5111f121b7b5f8533d18d98e1ec8ade294c62cc3

Although the methods are described below, the preferred way to use this class
is via the ServiceProvider:

  $sp->generate_saml_id( args );

Any arguments provided will be ignored if C<strong_token> is used (see below)
or will be passed to C<weak_token> for the fallback implementation.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor.  Should not be called directly.  Instead, call:

  Authen::NZRealMe->token_generator();

=head2 saml_id

Generates and returns a hex-encoded random token (guaranteed to start with a
letter) using C<strong_token> if possible and C<weak_token> otherwise.

=head2 strong_token

On systems where the device F</dev/urandom> is available, it will be used.
This method will read 20 bytes from the random device and return a hex-encoded
representation of those bytes.

Otherwise, returns undef.

=head2 weak_token

Will be called if C<strong_token> is not able to find a strong source of random
data.  As this method uses Perl's built-in C<rand> function, which is not a
cryptographically strong source of randomness, its use should be avoided.

If your platform does not provide F</dev/urandom>, you are advised to use the
C<< Authen::NZRealMe->register_class >> method to provide an alternative
implementation for C<'token_generator'>.
